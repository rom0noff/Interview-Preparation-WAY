# Software Design principles 
Software Design Principles are a set of guidelines that helps developers to make a good system design.

In the development process, the time for writing code will only consume from 20 to 40 percent, remaining we will read code and maintain the system. So, Making a good system design is very important. In my opinion, a good system should have a good code base: easy to read, easy to understand, easy to maintain(add/modify feature and fix bugs), and easy to extend the system in the future. That will reduce development time, resources, and make us happy more.

Basically, Software Design is only a part of the development process in the Design Step(Please take a look at the below image about the development process). Before we do Software Design(low-level) we have to complete Software Architecture (high-level). Choosing an architecture will determine how to deal with performance, fault tolerance, scalability, and reliability. Software Design is responsible for code level(low-level) such as, what each module is doing, class scope, methods purposes, and so on. You can imagine like when you build a house or a building.
