# SOLID principles 
SOLID principles are object-oriented design concepts relevant to software development. SOLID is an acronym for five other class-design principles: Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.
